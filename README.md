# No YouTube Shorts (v1.2.0)

A powerful, privacy-respecting Chrome extension that removes YouTube Shorts from your feed and redirects Shorts links to the regular video player.

## Features

### 🚫 Core Blocking
- **Redirects Shorts**: Automatically sends you to the normal player when opening a Short.
- **Cleans Feeds**: Removes Shorts shelves, carousel items, and search results.
- **Hides Navigation**: Removes the "Shorts" tab and sidebar buttons.

### ✨ New in v1.2.0
- **Channel Whitelist**: Allow specific creators (e.g., `@MKBHD`) to show Shorts in your feed.
- **Context Menu**: Right-click any Short link to "Open as Regular Video".
- **Instant Redirect Mode (Beta)**: Optional setting to use advanced browser network rules for faster, instant redirection (note: disables redirect whitelist).
